# Gemini Discord Bot

 Discord bot that leverages the power of Google's Gemini-Pro API to interact with users in both text and image formats. It processes messages and images sent to it, generating creative and engaging responses.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Text Responses:** Gemini Bot can generate text responses to messages using Google's generative AI.
- **Image Processing:** The bot can also respond to images, combining text and visual inputs for a more engaging interaction. (Images should be under 2.5 Megs)
- **User Message History Management:** It maintains a history of user interactions via discordIDs, allowing for context-aware conversations.
- **Customizable Settings:** Users can adjust various parameters like message history length and AI response settings.

### Setup:

## Installation

1. Install the required Python libraries: run "pip install -U -r requirements.txt" in the Shell Tab
2. Be sure that your Google Gemini AI Api Key and Discord Bot Token are added as Secrets Variables in the Secrets Tab
3. Run (You can use it on Replit or Render.com, anywhere you can and also use Uptime Robot)
The bot will start listening to messages in your Discord server. It responds to direct mentions or direct messages.

## Configuration

1. Open `GeminiBotConfig.py` File

2. Fill in the following values:

- `MAX_HISTORY`: The maximum number of messages to retain in history for each user. 0 will disable history
- `System_Prompt`: A special Prompt that instructs the Gemini Pro AI model to follow a certain behavior or interaction style when generating text or image responses.
- `Temperature_Text`: A parameter that controls the creativity or randomness of the text generated by Gemini Pro. A higher temperature results in more diverse and creative output, while a lower temperature makes the output more deterministic and focused.
- `Top_P_Text`: A parameter that controls the tokens that are considered for text generation by Gemini Pro. Only the tokens that have a cumulative probability mass equal to or higher than top_p are kept for sampling. A lower top_p value makes the output more constrained by the most probable tokens, while a higher top_p value allows for more diversity and exploration.
- `Top_K_Text`: A parameter that controls the number of highest probability tokens that are considered for text generation by Gemini Pro. Only the top_k tokens are kept for sampling. A lower top_k value makes the output more deterministic and focused, while a higher top_k value allows for more diversity and creativity.
- `Max_Output_Tokens_Text`: A parameter that controls the maximum number of tokens that Gemini Pro can generate for a text response. A lower max_output_tokens_text value makes the output shorter and more concise, while a higher max_output_tokens_text value allows for longer and more detailed output.
- `Temperature_Text`: A parameter that controls the creativity or randomness of the text generated by Gemini Pro Vision based on the image it has seen. A higher temperature results in more diverse and creative output, while a lower temperature makes the output more deterministic and focused.
- `Top_P_Text`: A parameter that controls the tokens that are considered for text generation by Gemini Pro. Only the tokens that have a cumulative probability mass equal to or higher than top_p are kept for sampling. A lower top_p value makes the output more constrained by the most probable tokens, while a higher top_p value allows for more diversity and exploration.
- `Top_K_Text`: A parameter that controls the number of highest probability tokens that are considered for text generation by Gemini Pro Vision based on the image it has seen. Only the top_k tokens are kept for sampling. A lower top_k value makes the output more deterministic and focused, while a higher top_k value allows for more diversity and creativity.
- `Max_Output_Tokens_Text`: A parameter that controls the maximum number of tokens that Gemini Pro Vision can generate for a text response based on the image it has seen. A lower max_output_tokens_text value makes the output shorter and more concise, while a higher max_output_tokens_text value allows for longer and more detailed output.


3. Run `GeminiDiscordBot.py` or to make it easier for you, i made a start.bat file you can just click that

## Commands

- **Mention or DM the bot to activate:** History only works on pure text input
- **Send an Image:** The bot will respond with an AI-generated interpretation or related content.
- **Type 'RESET':** Clears the message history for the user.

## Development

Feel free to fork the project and customize it according to your needs (Like i did lol). Make sure to follow the guidelines set by Discord and Google for bot development and API usage.
